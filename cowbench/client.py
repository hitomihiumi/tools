Report two things about the outlined cow.

posture - exactly one of:

activity - exactly one of:
  feeding     the head is down at the feed barrier or in the feed alley, eating or reaching for feed
  drinking    the head is over or inside a water trough
  ruminating  chewing cud while not at feed and not at water; the jaw works sideways, head up or resting
  none        none of the three above can be seen

Both fields are independent: a lying cow can be ruminating, a standing cow can be feeding.
