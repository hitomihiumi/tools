"""Metrics.

Three error rates, not one. Posture and activity are separate axes in the
annotation, so a single number hides which of the two the model is bad at -
and they behave very differently: posture is a 2-way call on an easy visual
cue, activity is a 4-way call that needs the scene around the cow.
