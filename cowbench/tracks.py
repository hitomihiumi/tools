"""Linking the same cow across the keyframes of a clip, and voting over it.

The annotation carries no animal identity: every keyframe is boxed
independently, and nothing says that box 4 at t=2s is the same cow as box 7 at
t=3s. But the camera is fixed and the keyframes are one second apart, so
overlap is enough to link them - and the labels confirm it, being constant
along 98% of the tracks for posture and 91% for activity.

That makes the six answers about one cow six samples of the same question. The
model is asked each of them independently and at temperature 0, so the
disagreements are not sampling noise but genuine per-frame difficulty:
occlusion by a passing animal, a bad moment for the pose. A majority vote over
the track discards exactly those.

Nothing here costs a model call. It is post-processing over results.jsonl.
