    Only needed for rumination, and only because of what rumination is: chewing
    cud. On a single still frame it is not observable at all - a ruminating cow
    and an idle one are the same picture - so grading a still-image answer
    against that label measures nothing. A short window of frames at least puts
    the jaw movement in front of the model.

    Verified against this dataset: the keyframe labelframes/<id>_<t>.jpg is
    exactly frame t*25 of <id>.mp4 (25 fps, 10 s clips), so the annotation and
    these frames refer to the same moment.

    Caveat that belongs in the report, not in a comment only: the bounding box
    is annotated on the keyframe alone. Over a +-1 s window a moving cow drifts
    out of its own outline, which is the reason the default span is small.
