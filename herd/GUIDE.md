# herd — the full guide

For anyone opening this code for the first time: what the system does, which part of
the code does what, how to train and run it, what has been checked, and what is left
to do.

`README.md` is the short overview; this is the long one.

---

## 1. What the system is

A barn of up to 60 cows, 4–5 IP cameras looking down (their views partly overlap),
the video streamed to the cloud. The system must:

- **identify every cow without RFID** — the network names the cows itself, and says
  **NaN** when it is not sure;
- **every second**, record each cow's posture and activity: lying / standing, feeding /
  drinking / nothing;
- **once a minute**, take 7 seconds of video (a burst) and from it detect
  **rumination**, confirm **who the cow is** (gait, coat pattern) and, once labels
  exist, **lameness**;
- **every 3 days**, produce a CSV per cow; **alert** the vet when a cow lies or
  ruminates clearly differently from her usual; collect the **vet's verdicts** and
  count how many alerts were false;
- survive the **Tuesday 10:00** change-over, when some cows leave and new ones arrive.

Until the barn's own footage exists, everything is trained and checked on the public
**CBVD-5** dataset (side-view cow videos, 10 s per clip, posture and activity
annotated on one frame a second). What CBVD-5 cannot provide is built as a ready
scaffold that switches on with the barn's footage (section 8).

---

## 2. Map: requirement → where in the code → state

| Requirement | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Find the cows in a frame | RT-DETRv2 detector (`cowbench/detector.py`, class `Live`) | works; on CBVD-5 finds 74% of cows (51% of the far ones), see section 6 |
| Cameras overlap | a mask per camera in the config: a cow counts where her box centre is (`common.in_mask`) | works |
| Follow a cow between frames | `pipeline.Tracker` (box overlap, once a second) | works |
| Posture and activity every second | `model.FrameHeads` on the DINOv2 vector of the crop (`pipeline.Camera.second`) | works; error 2.4–2.6% posture, 17–19% activity (on annotated boxes) |
| A 7 s, 25 fps burst a minute, cameras in turn | `pipeline.Camera.burst`, `step_burst` | works, tested with 5 cameras (section 6) |
| A small Temporal Transformer attends to the burst's frames | `model.TemporalModel` (3 layers, d=256) | works and is trained |
| The cow's embedding (fingerprint) = weighted average over the frames | `quality` head → frame weights → `fingerprint` | works; weights are learnt (directly with `--quality 1`) |
| Good burst / bad burst (mud, hidden behind another cow) | `--quality 1`: spoilt frames (`degrade.py`) teach the frame `quality` head; the NaN model judges the burst from the match and the frame qualities | **built, to be trained on the pod** (section 5, step 6) |
| Gait, identification across days | scaffold `barn_dataset.py` + `train.py --extra-train` | **waits for barn footage** (section 8.1) |
| K-means over the herd's week, the cluster closest to the fingerprint | `gallery.py`: per cow up to 6 k-means centres of her bursts over 7 days | works (tested on synthetic data) |
| NaN when unsure | `abstain.py`: p(right) from similarity, margin, quality; a cut-off | works: on CBVD-5 val answers ~86–91% of the time at ~0.3–1% wrong |
| New cows on Tuesdays 10:00 | `gallery.migration_due`, `enroll`, `retire` | works (synthetic data) |
| Rumination | `rumination` head on the burst + motion rhythm (`motion.py`) | works, but weak: F1 ≈ 0.39 on CBVD-5 (section 8.5) |
| Lameness | `lameness` head exists, **switched off** | **no labels** (section 8.3) |
| Time lying, standing, feeding, drinking, ruminating, idle | `report.py daily`, `store.py` | works |
| CSV every 3 days | `herd.py report csv` | works |
| Alerts: lame cows, lying and rumination deviations | `report.py alerts` (against the cow's own week) | works; which direction of lying is "worse" is a **setting** (section 8.4) |
| Vet verdicts, false alarms | `report.py verdict`, `alert-stats` | works |
| Is one GPU enough | `herd.py stress` | tested: 5 cameras, GPU busy 18% (section 6) |

## 3. How it runs in the barn (data flow)

```
IP cameras (RTSP)  ->  per camera a ring buffer of the last ~10 s (Full HD)
                       per camera 3 threads: reader, once-a-second, bursts

once a second (every camera):
   frame -> detector -> camera mask -> tracker -> a 224x224 crop of each cow
         -> DINOv2-S (frozen) -> FrameHeads -> posture, activity -> table seconds

once a minute (cameras in turn, 60/N s apart):
   the buffer's last 7 s (175 frames) -> detector on 5 of every 25 frames -> box chains,
   interpolated in between -> 175 crops per cow
         -> DINOv2-S -> 175 vectors
         -> pixel rhythm (motion.py, on the CPU alongside)
         -> TemporalModel -> weight of every frame, fingerprint (512 numbers),
                             rumination, posture, activity, lameness
         -> gallery: nearest cow + NaN model -> confirmed / tentative / unknown
         -> table bursts (who, ruminating or not, quality ...)
         -> (if enabled) every N-th burst into the training cache

at night (02:00): the gallery rebuilds its k-means centres from confirmed bursts,
                  enrols new cows, retires the ones that left
Tuesday 10:00:    the change-over starts

reports: track -> cow (if >= 2/3 of the track's confirmed bursts name one cow, else NaN)
         -> minutes per cow and day -> 3-day CSV, alerts, verdicts
```

Why it is built this way:

- **Only small models, only on small crops.** The detector and DINOv2-S are light. A
  large vision-language model (Muse) was tried before: about 2 frames a second, too
  slow for 5 cameras.
- **A burst per camera, not per cow:** one 7 s window gives every cow in view at once.
- **The GPU is shared batch by batch,** and the once-a-second work goes first, so a
  large burst never delays a tick by more than one batch (`pipeline.GpuLock`).
- **A cow is counted by one camera:** each camera's mask covers only the floor it owns.
- **Reports do not pretend to see everything:** they carry observed minutes and
  shares, not just hours.

---

## 4. The models one by one

### 4.1 Detector (`cowbench/detector.py`)

RT-DETRv2 (a ResNet-50 CNN + a transformer), fine-tuned on the CBVD-5 boxes. Returns
cow boxes with a score. Settings that matter:

- **threshold** — lower finds more far cows and adds more boxes that are no cow;
  `herd.py eval-det` prints the error of the whole system at each threshold
  (section 6);
- **tiles** — besides the whole frame the detector also looks at two square halves; a
  far cow is 1.8x wider there; about 3x the work;
- a new detector for Full HD: `bash herd/run_pod.sh detector` (1088 input, zoom crops
  in training, threshold chosen by F2 — a missed cow costs more than an extra box).
  It trains the deeper R101 backbone by default (`PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r101vd`, ~76M
  parameters, Apache-2.0, never tried before); `DET_MODEL=PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd`
  trains the R50 (~42M) used so far, for a like-for-like comparison.

### 4.2 Frame encoder — DINOv2-S (`model.FrameEncoder`)

Frozen. Turns a 224x224 crop into a vector: CLS + the patch tokens pooled over a
GRID x GRID grid (GRID=2: 384·5 = 1920 numbers). The grid keeps "what is where" in
the crop (head / body). Training ("Stage A") runs on vectors computed once in advance,
which is why it is fast.

### 4.3 Frame heads — `FrameHeads`

Posture (standing / lying) and activity (feeding / drinking / none) from one vector —
the once-a-second path. With `POS=1` they also get the box's position in the frame
(the feed barrier is a place in a fixed camera's picture). With `DET_KEYS=1` they also
learn on the detector's boxes, not only on the annotation's.

### 4.4 Temporal Transformer — `TemporalModel`

Input: the burst's 175 frame vectors + the real time of each frame (a sinusoidal
encoding, so dropped frames do not break the rhythm). Every frame attends to every
other frame of the burst. Outputs:

| Output | What | How it is trained |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` (per frame) | how useful the frame is → frame weights (softmax) | through the ID loss; with `--quality 1` also directly: spoilt frames (`degrade.py`) must score low |
| `frame_ids` (per frame) | one frame's fingerprint (512) | ID loss |
| `fingerprint` | **the weighted average of the frame fingerprints** — the burst's fingerprint | SupCon: two pieces of one burst are one cow, the rest of the batch other cows. With barn data: all bursts of one cow |
| `rumination` | probability of rumination | from the CBVD-5 labels; with `MOTION=1` it also gets the motion rhythm |
| `posture`, `activity` | posture, activity over the burst | from the labels |
| `lameness` | lameness score | **no labels** — off |

### 4.5 Motion rhythm (`motion.py`)

Rumination is chewing about once a second. Over the burst's 175 crops, the spectrum of
every pixel's change (grey, 56x56) over the 7 s is computed; on a 4x4 grid, the power
and the share of motion in bands around 1 Hz are taken. On CBVD-5 (side view, from
afar) it barely helped: the jaw is a couple of pixels.

### 4.6 Gallery (`gallery.py`) — k-means per cow

Every cow has up to 6 k-means centres (spherical, cosine) of her confirmed
fingerprints over the last 7 days: lying, walking, dirty and clean look different, and
one average would blur them. A burst's fingerprint is compared with every centre of
every cow:

- the nearest cow, its similarity, **the margin to the second-best cow**, the burst's
  quality → NaN model → p(right);
- p ≥ cut-off → **confirmed** (the cow's name);
- similar to someone but p below the cut-off → **tentative** (NaN in reports);
- similar to no one → **unknown** → pooled; a group of tracks seen often enough becomes
  a new cow `new-<date>-<n>`.

On the first start the gallery is empty and enrols the whole herd this way. Every
night the centres are rebuilt from confirmed bursts only, so a mistake is not learnt.
From Tuesday 10:00 the gallery expects new cows and retires those not seen for 48 h
after it. `names.json` (optional) maps the names to ear tags in reports.

The difference from the letter of the brief: the brief says "one k-means over the
whole herd". Here every cow has her own k-means, and names come from enrolment — the
same "nearest cluster to the fingerprint", only sturdier.

### 4.7 NaN model (`abstain.py`)

A small logistic regression: p(the answer is right) from the similarity, the margin to
the second cow, frame quality and cow size.
It is fitted on the dev clips (spoilt bursts included, when they have been made). The
cut-off is set so that at most `MAX_ERROR` (1% by default) of the answers given are
wrong. "Not sure" is a NaN in the reports.

---

## 5. Training on the pod (CBVD-5)

### 5.1 Everything with one command

```bash
cd /tools && git pull
RUN=run7 POS=1 bash herd/run_pod.sh     # runs in tmux session "herd"
bash herd/run_pod.sh log                 # follow the log
```

Every step resumes where it stopped; what is already computed is not recomputed.

| Step | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Python environment `/workspace/herd/.venv` | |
| 2 | CBVD-5 with its videos | `/workspace/cbvd5` |
| 3–4 | DINOv2 vectors of every burst crop and annotated keyframe crop | `/workspace/herd/features/{train,val}/<clip>.npz`, `index.jsonl`, `meta.json` |
| 5 | motion rhythm of every burst (CPU) — `MOTION=1` | `<clip>.motion.npz` |
| 6 | spoilt burst frames (GPU) — `QUALITY=1` | `<clip>.degraded.npz` |
| 7 | crops from the detector's boxes — `DET_KEYS=1`, needs a detector | `features/train/keys_aug.*` |
| 8 | training and evaluation | `/workspace/herd/<RUN>/model.pt`, `eval_val.json`, `heads.json`, `eval-val/` |
| 9 | NaN model | `<RUN>/abstain.json` |
| 10 | evaluation on the detector's boxes | `<RUN>/eval_det.json`, `<RUN>/eval-val-det/` |

Knobs (`NAME=value bash herd/run_pod.sh`):

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RUN` | run1 | run name (folder) |
| `EPOCHS` | 40 | maximum epochs (early stopping applies) |
| `POS` | 0 | 1: the heads know where the cow is in the frame (1 recommended) |
| `MOTION` | 1 | motion rhythm for rumination |
| `QUALITY` | 1 | frame quality taught directly on spoilt frames |
| `DET_KEYS` | 1 | frame heads also learn on the detector's boxes |
| `GRID` | 2 | DINOv2 patch grid (4: finer, features 3.4x larger) |
| `MARGIN` | 0.1 | context around the box in the crop (0.5 was worse: neighbouring cows) |
| `MAX_ERROR` | 0.01 | error budget for NaN |
| `DET` | auto | the detector's `best/` folder (else the newest trained one) |

### 5.2 Other pod commands

```bash
bash herd/run_pod.sh detector    # a new Full HD detector, R101 (hours), then eval-det of the newest run
DET_MODEL=PekingU/rtdetr_v2_r50vd bash herd/run_pod.sh detector   # the same with R50, to compare
DET_SIZE=960 DET_ZOOM=0 DET_TILES=0 DET_SELECT=f1 DET_TAG=r101_960 bash herd/run_pod.sh detector
                                 # R101 with the first detector's settings: only the backbone differs
bash herd/run_pod.sh stress      # 5 cameras in real time on one GPU (~7 min)
CAMERAS=20 RUN=run7 bash herd/run_pod.sh stress
bash herd/run_pod.sh stop
```

### 5.3 Single commands (`python herd/herd.py ...`)

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `extract --split train\|val` | DINOv2 vectors |
| `motion --split ...` | motion rhythm |
| `degrade --split ...` | spoilt frames for `--quality` |
| `keys --split train --detector D` | crops from the detector's boxes for `--det-keys` |
| `train --features F --out R [--pos 1 --motion 1 --quality 1 --det-keys 1] [--extra-train ...]` | training (runs eval at the end) |
| `eval --features F --out R [--extra-val ...]` | evaluate again |
| `abstain --features F --run R` | NaN model |
| `eval-det --run R [--tiles 1] [--threshold t]` | the whole path on the detector's boxes, threshold sweep |
| `stress --model M --detector D` | load test |
| `run --config barn.toml` | run in the barn |
| `report --config barn.toml csv\|alerts\|verdict\|alert-stats\|daily` | reports |
| `gallery --config barn.toml` | the cows the system knows |
| `barn sheet\|build ...` | barn data for training (section 8.1) |

One table of every run: `python cowbench/summary.py /workspace/herd /workspace/lora-runs`.

## 6. Reading the results, and what has been achieved

### 6.1 Evaluation files

- `eval_val.json`:
  - `reid_top1_clip`, `reid_top1_all` — was the same cow found again 3.5 s later
    (among the clip's cows / among all);
  - `frame_posture_error`, `frame_activity_error` — once-a-second errors on annotated
    boxes;
  - `rumination_*` — rumination from bursts (`_f1`, `_best_f1`; `_share_true` and
    `_share_called_time` — the true share of rumination and the share reports will
    show);
  - `frame_quality_auc` — does the quality head tell spoilt frames from clean ones
    (1.0 always, 0.5 chance);
  - `reid_spoilt_weighted` and `reid_spoilt_uniform` — re-identification from spoilt
    bursts with the frame weights and with a plain average; the difference is what the
    weights win;
  - `barn_reid_cross_track_top1` — barn data only: identification across tracks and
    days.
- `eval-val/report.md` — the full cowbench report (the same 2532 cows as the LoRA
  runs).
- `eval_det.json` and `eval-val-det/` — the same with the detector's boxes, a missed cow
  counted wrong; plus the detector's recall and precision, recall by cow size, the
  threshold sweep.
- `abstain.json` — how often it answers at which error budget (dev, val, val_spoilt).
- `stress_herd_5cam.md` — whether the GPU keeps up.

### 6.2 Results on CBVD-5 (before `QUALITY` / `DET_KEYS` / the new detector)

| | value |
|---|---|
| Error "posture and activity both right", annotated boxes | 19.7% (run4), 21.4% (run5) |
| Posture / activity | 2.4–2.6% / 17–19% |
| The same on the detector's boxes (misses are errors) | 45.4%; on the cows it found 26.6% |
| Detector recall / precision (IoU 0.5) | 74.4% / 76.0% (at IoU 0.3: 83.7% / 85.6%) |
| Recall by cow size: smallest → largest | 50.7% → 95.6% |
| Same cow found again 3.5 s later (all val cows) | 97.5–98.4% |
| Rumination F1 | ≈0.39 (the motion rhythm did not help) |
| NaN: cut-off for 0.5% wrong on dev → on val wrong / answered | 0.3% / 86% (run2), 1.0% / 91% (run4) |
| 5 cameras, one RTX PRO 6000: keeps up / GPU busy / cameras estimate | yes / 18% / ~22 (1280 px frames, 960 detector without tiles — recheck with Full HD and tiles) |

High re-identification "3.5 s later" does not mean "recognised tomorrow": CBVD-5 has
no cow ids and every cow is in a single 10 s clip. Identification across days can only
be checked on the barn's data.

---

## 7. Running in the barn

1. `cp herd/config.example.toml barn.toml` and fill in:
   - `[farm]` — time zone, the change-over day and hour;
   - `[[cameras]]` — `id`, `url` (RTSP), `mask` — the polygon of floor that belongs to
     this camera alone (0–1 coordinates). Every patch of floor must be in exactly one
     mask;
   - `[model] checkpoint`, `[detector] weights` (and `threshold` from `eval-det`);
   - `[store] path` — where the SQLite file, the gallery and the cache go.
2. Run: `python herd/herd.py run --config barn.toml`. For recorded files instead of
   RTSP: `--start 2026-10-07T06:00` and `url` = the file's path.
3. In the first days the gallery enrols the herd by itself (`new-<date>-<n>`). For ear
   tags in the reports, create `names.json` next to the store:
   `{"new-2026-10-07-3": "UA1234"}`.
4. Reports:
   ```bash
   python herd/herd.py report --config barn.toml csv                 # the last 3 days
   python herd/herd.py report --config barn.toml alerts --day 2026-10-07
   python herd/herd.py report --config barn.toml verdict --alert 12 --confirmed yes --diagnosis "..."
   python herd/herd.py report --config barn.toml alert-stats         # how many alerts were confirmed
   ```
   CSV columns: `period_start, period_end, cow_id, label, observed_min, lying_min,
   standing_min, feeding_min, drinking_min, ruminating_min, idle_min, lying_share,
   rumination_share, lameness_score, lameness_bursts, bursts`. The `NaN` row is the time
   on tracks no cow could be given.
5. To train on your own cows, set `[training_cache] enabled = true` (section 8.1).

Load: up to ~20 cameras on one RTX PRO 6000 by the GPU estimate; about 1.5 GB of RAM
per camera at Full HD. With `tiles` the detector takes about 3x longer — rerun
`stress`.

---

## 8. What is unfinished and how to finish it

### 8.1 Identification across days, and gait — needs barn footage

**Why it is not done:** CBVD-5 has no cow ids, so the model only learns "the same cow a
few seconds later". That task can be solved by appearance alone, so the model is never
pushed to learn gait.

**What is ready:** the cache in the pipeline, the dataset builder, identity-aware
training, evaluation across tracks and days.

**How to finish:**

1. In `barn.toml`: `[training_cache] enabled = true` (by default every 10th burst,
   ~250 MB an hour, capped at 200 GB). Run for 1–2 weeks.
2. `python herd/herd.py barn sheet --cache <store_dir>/training_cache --out tracks.html` —
   a page per day, one row per track: thumbnails of the cow and the gallery's guess.
3. From the page, write `merges.csv`: lines `identity,track` — tracks that are one cow
   (identity: her ear tag or any name). A few dozen cows over a few days are enough.
   Without `merges.csv` a track counts as a cow by itself (already minutes to hours, in
   different postures).
4. Build the dataset, the last days held out for evaluation:
   ```bash
   python herd/herd.py barn build --cache <...>/training_cache --out /workspace/herd/features_barn \
       --merges merges.csv --val-from 2026-11-01
   ```
5. Train together with CBVD-5 and evaluate:
   ```bash
   python herd/herd.py train --features /workspace/herd/features --out /workspace/herd/run_barn1 \
       --pos 1 --motion 1 --quality 1 --extra-train /workspace/herd/features_barn/train
   python herd/herd.py eval --features /workspace/herd/features --out /workspace/herd/run_barn1 \
       --extra-val /workspace/herd/features_barn/val
   python herd/herd.py abstain --features /workspace/herd/features --run /workspace/herd/run_barn1
   ```
   Watch `barn_reid_cross_track_top1` in `eval_val.json`: the share of bursts whose
   nearest burst from another track (and day) is the same cow.
6. Put the new model in `[model] checkpoint`. Start the gallery afresh by deleting the
   `gallery/` folder next to the store: old fingerprints come from another model and do
   not compare with new ones.

`--gallery-labels 1` also joins tracks the gallery confidently named as one cow. More
data, but the model also learns the gallery's mistakes. Use it only once the NaN
cut-off is strict.

### 8.2 A detector for cameras looking down

**Why:** the detector is trained on CBVD-5 (side view). From above, cows look
different, though they overlap less.

**How to finish:**

1. Cut frames from the barn's videos and draw boxes around the cows in CVAT. The tools
   are in `cowbench/label/`: `prelabel.py` (pre-labels with the current detector),
   `cvat2ava.py` (exports to the CBVD-5 format), and the labelling manual
   `manual_labeling_uk.docx`. A few hundred frames from different cameras and times of
   day are enough.
2. Train: `python cowbench/detector.py train --root <dataset> --out /workspace/herd/detector_top
   --size 1088 --zoom 0.5 --tiles 1 --select f2`.
3. `herd.py eval-det` on the barn's labelled frames → the threshold into the config.
   Then `stress`.

### 8.3 Lameness — needs labels

The `lameness` head exists in the model but is switched off
(`[lameness] enabled = false`): there are no lameness labels in CBVD-5 or anywhere
else yet.

**How to finish:**

1. Collect labels: which cow was lame and when. The vet's locomotion scores (1–5) will
   do; they can be tied to bursts through the verdicts.
2. Add a `lameness` field (a number) to the burst rows, and in `train.py`, next to
   `l_post`, add a loss on `o["lameness"]` (regression; skip rows without a label, as
   `masked_ce` does). Right now this head takes no part in training at all.
3. Set `[lameness] enabled = true` and choose `alert_score`.

### 8.4 Which lying deviation is "worse"

It is not known whether to alert when a cow lies more than usual, less, or both. Right
now alerts are raised both ways: `[alerts] lying_directions = ["low", "high"]`. After a
few weeks of verdicts, check `report alert-stats` and keep the direction that the vet
confirms.

### 8.5 Rumination

On CBVD-5, F1 ≈ 0.39 is this dataset's ceiling: few ruminating bursts in val (~67),
side view from afar. Rumination minutes in reports are currently overstated (≈25–30%
against 15%). Since alerts compare a cow with her own week, a constant overstatement
hurts them less.

**How to finish:** label rumination on the barn's footage (7 s pieces: ruminating /
not; CVAT can do it as an activity) and fine-tune. If the jaw is not visible from
above, feed a larger crop of the head and neck instead of the whole cow.

### 8.6 Coat colour and NaN

Solid-coloured cows (no pattern) are harder to identify. The system should say NaN for
them more often by itself: their margin to the second cow and their frame quality are
lower. This can only be checked in the barn: look at `abstain.json` on barn data and at
how often such cows get NaN. If needed, give them a separate error budget.

### 8.7 Feed and water zones

Feeding / drinking depends strongly on where the cow is. With `POS=1` the model learns
this from the box position, but only for the CBVD-5 cameras. For the barn, either label
activities on its own frames (as in 8.5) or add explicit feed-barrier and trough zones
to the camera config (not done).

### 8.8 Stage B — fine-tuning the encoder itself

DINOv2 is frozen for now. If Stage A plateaus on barn data, the next step is LoRA on
the encoder and training end to end from images. Slower (images in the loop), but the
model sees fine detail: coat pattern, the jaw.

Store tables (`store.py`):

- `seconds` — track and second: box, posture, activity;
- `bursts` — track and burst: the gallery's decision (`state`, `cow`, `sim`, `margin`,
  `p`), `rumination_p`, `ruminating`, burst posture and activity, lameness, frame
  quality;
- `events` — enrolments, retirements, change-overs, nightly rebuilds;
- `alerts`, `verdicts` — alerts and the vet's answers.

## 10. Common problems

- **`no trained detector`** — set `DET=/path/to/best` or copy the `detector/best`
  folder (it holds `det_train_meta.json`) under `/workspace`.
- **`--quality 1 needs the spoilt frames`** — step 6 (`herd.py degrade`) has not run.
- **`--motion 1 needs the motion features`** — step 5 has not run.
- **`bursts differ from the extracted ones`** — the features were made from different
  annotations; rerun `extract`.
- **The log shows an old run** — `bash herd/run_pod.sh log` follows the newest log; for
  a given one: `RUN=run7 bash herd/run_pod.sh log`.
- **The cowbench report is stale** — after `eval`, rerun `cowbench.py ... score` and
  `report`.
- **GPU out of memory next to other jobs** — the detector falls back to the CPU (`stress`
  shows it), but is then slow.

## 11. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| burst | 7 s of video at 25 fps, once a minute per camera |
| crop | a cow's box cut out and resized to 224x224 |
| fingerprint | 512 numbers describing a cow from a burst; compared by cosine |
| track | the same cow on one camera until the tracker loses her |
| gallery | the known cows and their k-means centres |
| confirmed / tentative / unknown | surely this cow / looks like her but not sure (NaN) / none of the known cows |
| NaN | the system honestly does not know who it is |
| re-ID top-1 | the share of cases where the nearest fingerprint is the same cow |
| AUC | 1.0 separates perfectly, 0.5 is chance |
| IoU | overlap of two boxes (0–1) |
| detector recall / precision | share of cows found / share of boxes that are really cows |
